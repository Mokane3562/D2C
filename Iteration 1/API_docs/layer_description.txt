    The user interface will consist of the divs and buttons
required to allow user interaction with the system.
Each clickable element will recieve an event handler
that will be added to it through an angular controller. 

    The handlers will implement their behavior through using
the services provided by the service layer as described in the 
AngularJS_services.txt file

    The services will be implemented by making http requests to
the server back-end, using the Web API as described in the
WebAPI.txt file. These http requests will be handled asynchornously
to allow the web app to never lag or stall.

    The WebAPI is implemented as a series of Jax-RS resources
which use the java classes in JavaClasses.txt as Java decodings
of the JSON objects in the javascriptObjects.txt file.
Each resource will have methods that use prepared SQL statements
and the arguments to the method to insert, update, or select a row
in the database.

    The Database will be a MySQL database, whose schema is described
in the files located in the Database folder
