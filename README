ITERATION ONE SUBMITTED FEBRUARY 8TH 2016
Description of changes, additions and refinements

NOTE: All of these refinements/changes are in addition to the entire
design/project being constantly updated and worked on throughout
each iteration. This list is just to point out major changes
to parts of the project which were specifically pointed out to be 
fixed and major items which are added to our GIT repository. 

Additions to Iteration 0:
Within Folder "Iteration 0" > COMP4770 Team G Project Design Document.pdf
- We have created a new, more accurate, domain model from 
the one that was submitted with iteration 0. 
- We have added missing entities and extra associations that 
are needed. We have supplied a Data Dictionary which was missing 
from Iteration 0. 
- Our Data Dictionary outlines the key words/concepts which are 
used throughout the domain model, use cases and user stories.
- The Statechart has been revised to encompass changes we are 
making so that a Prof can access both a TA and Student homepages, 
as well as the TA being able to access the Student homepage. 
- Use Cases (4, 5, 6)  have been revised to be more flexible when 
using the Systems’ Editor to work on assignments/files.

Iteration 1:
Database Schema
Rough HTML draft of our application (GUI)
Web API (Angular services, layer description, Java Classes, Java Resources)
