1: Make prepared sql statements for every insert, update, and select required
	to get information from the database to the server.
2: Add calls to the sql statements (through the SQLHandler) to get the results
	from the SQL selects/updates/inserts for each WebAPI call that POSTs
	or GETs information from the database.
3: Using the c_compile_request, c_compile_service, and 
	CodeResource.compileCCode path as an example, make the angular services
	required to call all Resource Class methods.
