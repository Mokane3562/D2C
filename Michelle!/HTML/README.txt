Hello!

Open any of the html files attached to see a very rough
draft of how our program will be layed out!

We will have a menu button located at the top right of each
page which will allow quick access to any of the main pages
each user will need to use. As well as three main tabs which 
allows the user to quickly and easily switch back and forth to 
their accounts once they have signed in, given the user has
access to the different types of accounts.

The menu options will change depending on which tab has been
selected.

Lots more work to do!
Have a good one!
